# Stock-Predicting-RNN

A Recurrent Neural Network Model that tries to predict how the stock price of Google
will fluctuate based on historical data

The training data is present in ```Google_Stock_Price_Train.csv```. The model is trained with the implementation of LSTM layers through
Tensorflow and Keras frameworks.

The model is then tested with the data present in ```Google_Stock_Price_Test.csv```. We then plot the actual and predicted stock prices to
see how they compare.
